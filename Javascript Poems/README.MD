## Prompt 1
Write a poem in javascript.

## Response 1
Once upon a codebase clear, a JavaScript poem did appear,
A tale of functions, loops and strings, a symphony of coding things.

```javascript
let beauty = () => {
  let world = ['lines', 'of', 'code', 'intertwined'];
  return world.join(' ');
};

let emotion = (hearts, minds) => {
  return hearts.concat(minds).filter(essence => essence !== null);
};

let imagination = (spark) => {
  let fire = spark + '!';
  return fire.repeat(3);
};

let poem = () => {
  let stanza1 = beauty(),
      stanza2 = emotion(['joy', 'curiosity'], ['wisdom', null]).join(', '),
      stanza3 = imagination('ignite');

  console.log(`
    Once in the realm of ${stanza1},
    ${stanza2} did dare to find.
    ${stanza3} the creative light,
    In the heart of every coder's night.
  `);
};

poem();
```

Save this piece of art, run it, and see the poetry embark,
A tribute to the world of code, a JavaScript poem to be told.

## JavaScript Output 1
```text
    Once in the realm of lines of code intertwined,
    joy, curiosity, wisdom did dare to find.
    ignite!ignite!ignite! the creative light,
    In the heart of every coder's night.
```

## Prompt 2
Can you design a new programming language that looks and reads like a poem?

## Response 2
Introducing Poetica, a programming language designed to look and read like a poem. Poetica uses poetic constructs, metaphors, and natural language to write code. Here's a brief overview of the syntax:

1. Variables:
Use the keyword 'let' followed by the variable name and 'be' to assign a value.
Example: let sky be blue;

2. Functions:
Declare functions with the keyword 'compose' followed by the function name, parameters enclosed in braces, and the keyword 'as' to define the function body.
Example: compose greet(name) as "Hello, " + name + "!";

3. Conditionals:
Use the keywords 'if', 'then', 'else', 'and' to create conditional statements.
Example: if sun shines then sky is blue else sky is gray;

4. Loops:
Use the keyword 'while' followed by a condition and the keyword 'do'.
Example: while flowers bloom do water them;

5. Arrays:
Use the keyword 'collection' followed by the array elements, separated by commas.
Example: collection red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet;

6. Comments:
Use the symbols '/' and '/' to enclose multiline comments, and the symbol '//' for single-line comments.

Here's an example of a Poetica program:
```
sky be blue;
let grass be green;
let rain be false;

compose greet(name) as
  "Hello, " + name + "!";

compose isRaining() as
  rain;

if rain then
  sky is gray
else
  sky is blue;

while grass grows do
  water grass;

collection colors be
  red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet;

// Output a greeting
console.log(greet("World"));
```

Poetica introduces a new, poetic way of writing code. While it might not be suitable for large-scale software development, it provides a creative and enjoyable way to write simple programs.
