## Prompt 1
"Write a poem in javascript."

## Response 1
Once upon a codebase clear, a JavaScript poem did appear,
A tale of functions, loops and strings, a symphony of coding things.

```javascript
let beauty = () => {
  let world = ['lines', 'of', 'code', 'intertwined'];
  return world.join(' ');
};

let emotion = (hearts, minds) => {
  return hearts.concat(minds).filter(essence => essence !== null);
};

let imagination = (spark) => {
  let fire = spark + '!';
  return fire.repeat(3);
};

let poem = () => {
  let stanza1 = beauty(),
      stanza2 = emotion(['joy', 'curiosity'], ['wisdom', null]).join(', '),
      stanza3 = imagination('ignite');

  console.log(`
    Once in the realm of ${stanza1},
    ${stanza2} did dare to find.
    ${stanza3} the creative light,
    In the heart of every coder's night.
  `);
};

poem();
```

Save this piece of art, run it, and see the poetry embark,
A tribute to the world of code, a JavaScript poem to be told.

## JavaScript Output 1
```text
    Once in the realm of lines of code intertwined,
    joy, curiosity, wisdom did dare to find.
    ignite!ignite!ignite! the creative light,
    In the heart of every coder's night.
```
